            About Us
          </Typography>
          <Typography sx={{ mt: 4 }} textAlign={'center'}  paragraph>
            We believe movie nights should be exciting, not stressful. We know how overwhelming it can be to scroll endlessly through streaming platforms, trying to decide what to watch. That’s why we set out to create something different — a smarter, more engaging, and truly personalized way to find the perfect movie.

            🎯 Our Mission
          </Typography>
          <Typography textAlign={'center'}  paragraph>
            Our mission is simple: To help people discover movies they’ll love, without the hassle. We combine fun, user interaction with intelligent recommendations to guide users toward films that truly match their mood, interests, and personality — not just what’s trending.

            🤖 How It Works
          </Typography>
          <Typography textAlign={'center'}  paragraph>
            At the core of our platform is an interactive quiz — designed to be short, fun, and surprisingly accurate. Instead of asking you to browse through endless categories, we ask questions about how you're feeling, what kind of experience you're craving, and what kind of stories you enjoy. Then, based on your responses, our system recommends a movie that aligns with your answers.
          </Typography>
          <Typography textAlign={'center'}  paragraph>
            It’s like having a movie-savvy friend who just gets your taste.

            💡 Our Story
          </Typography>
          <Typography textAlign={'center'}  paragraph>
            We’re a small but passionate team of movie enthusiasts, designers, and developers who came together around a shared love for film and a curiosity about how technology could make recommendations smarter — and more fun.
          </Typography>
          <Typography textAlign={'center'}  paragraph>
            We were tired of generic, one-size-fits-all suggestions from streaming platforms. So we started experimenting with quiz-based systems, tested ideas with friends, and slowly built what is now POPCORNPIX.

          <Typography textAlign={'center'}  paragraph>
            We’re constantly learning, growing, and improving. Every piece of feedback helps us make the site better, and we’re always exploring new features — from user profiles and watchlists, to genre deep-dives and themed quizzes.
